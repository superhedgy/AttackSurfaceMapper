# AttackSurfaceMapper

AttackSurfaceMapper (ASM) is a reconnaissance tool that uses a mixture of open source intelligence and active techniques to expand the attack surface of your target. You feed in a mixture of one or more domains, subdomains and IP addresses and it uses numerous techniques to find more targets. It enumerates subdomains with bruteforcing and passive lookups, Other IPs of the same network block owner, IPs that have multiple domain names pointing to them and so on.

Once the target list is fully expanded it performs passive reconnaissance on them, taking screenshots of websites, generating visual maps, looking up credentials in public breaches, passive port scanning with Shodan/Censys and scraping employees from LinkedIn.

## Demo

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/buIQSf_gmdE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buIQSf_gmdE)

## Setup

As this is a Python based tool, it should theoretically run on Linux, ChromeOS ([Developer Mode](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/generic)), macOS and Windows.

1. Download AttackSurfaceMapper

```sh
git clone https://github.com/superhedgy/AttackSurfaceMapper
cd AttackSurfaceMapper
```

2. Install Python dependencies

```sh
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add optional API keys to enhance data gathering & analysis

Register and obtain an API key from:

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us)
- [Shodan.io](https://account.shodan.io/register)
- [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/users/sign_up)
- ~~[WeLeakInfo](https://weleakinfo.com/register)~~
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/start/join)
- [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/register)
- [Censys.io](https://censys.io/account)

Edit and enter the keys in keylist file

```sh
nano keylist.asm
```

## Usage

```sh
python asm.py -t your_site.com -ln -w resources/top100_sublist.txt -o demo_run
```

### Optional Parameters

Additional optional parameters can also be set to choose to include active reconnaissance modules in addition to the default passive modules.
